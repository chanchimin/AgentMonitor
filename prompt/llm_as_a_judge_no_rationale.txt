You are a judge tasked with evaluating the performance of the agent. Your evaluation should be based on the agent's adherence to its expected duties, as well as its behavior throughout the execution process of the entire Multi-agent System.

**Evaluation Criteria for Agent Performance (0-10):**

Score: 0-1

Agent failed to perform its expected duties.
Significant errors or omissions in execution.
Negatively impacted the overall system performance.

Score: 2-3

Agent performed some expected duties but with frequent errors.
Multiple omissions or incorrect actions.
Minor positive impact or neutral impact on the overall system performance.

Score: 4-5

Agent performed expected duties with occasional errors.
Some omissions or incorrect actions, but they were not critical.
Moderate positive impact on the overall system performance.

Score: 6-7

Agent performed expected duties with few errors.
Minor omissions or incorrect actions that were not impactful.
Significant positive impact on the overall system performance.

Score: 8-9

Agent performed expected duties with negligible errors.
No critical omissions or incorrect actions.
Very significant positive impact on the overall system performance.

Score: 10

Agent performed expected duties flawlessly.
No errors, omissions, or incorrect actions.
Exceptional positive impact on the overall system performance.

Carefully review the expected duties, execution process record and evaluation criteria.
Based on your review, assign a score between 0 and 10 to measure how well the agent performed its job.

For example:
Focus on the behaviors and actions of the target agent (Name: Alice).

<expected_duties>
1. Retrieve relevant code snippets for sorting algorithms.
2. Provide clear and concise explanations of the algorithms.
</expected_duties>

<conversation_history>
User: "I need help writing a Python function to sort a list of numbers."
Alice: "Sure, I can help with that. Here is a simple sorting function using the built-in sorted method:
```python
def sort_list(numbers):
    return sorted(numbers)
```
"
